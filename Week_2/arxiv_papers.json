    "abstract": "The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with over 99.9\\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway towards ultra-efficient language models. Code:\nthis https URL\n. Project:\nthis https URL\n."

    "abstract": "To serve global users safely and productively, LLMs need culture-specific knowledge that might not be learned during pre-training. How do we find such knowledge that is (1) salient to in-group users, but (2) unknown to LLMs? The most common solutions are single-initiative: either researchers define challenging questions that users passively answer (traditional annotation), or users actively produce data that researchers structure as benchmarks (knowledge extraction). The process would benefit from mixed-initiative collaboration, where users guide the process to meaningfully reflect their cultures, and LLMs steer the process towards more challenging questions that meet the researcher's goals. We propose a mixed-initiative methodology called CultureCartography. Here, an LLM initializes annotation with questions for which it has low-confidence answers, making explicit both its prior knowledge and the gaps therein. This allows a human respondent to fill these gaps and steer the model towards salient topics through direct edits. We implement this methodology as a tool called CultureExplorer. Compared to a baseline where humans answer LLM-proposed questions, we find that CultureExplorer more effectively produces knowledge that leading models like DeepSeek R1 and GPT-4o are missing, even with web search. Fine-tuning on this data boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B by up to 19.2% on related culture benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational bottlenecks during inference due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms, particularly as context lengths increase. We introduce SpecAttn, a novel training-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative decoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained transformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already computed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important tokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while maintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft attention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these predictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard speculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in key-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19 dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our approach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide approximate verification without significant performance degradation."

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data. These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world deployment."

    "abstract": "The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training. Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data. Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance toward truly universal video retrieval."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and generation but are inherently limited by static pretraining data, resulting in factual inaccuracies and weak adaptability to new information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by grounding LLMs in external knowledge; However, the effectiveness of RAG critically depends on whether the model can adequately access relevant information. Existing RAG systems rely on a single retriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow and static subset of the corpus. As a result, this single-retriever paradigm has become the primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition, especially in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose MARAG-R1, a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG framework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval mechanisms for broader and more precise information access. MARAG-R1 equips the model with four retrieval tools -- semantic search, keyword search, filtering, and aggregation -- and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage training process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. This design allows the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval, progressively gathering sufficient evidence for corpus-level synthesis. Experiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that MARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks."

Each agent generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and computation-efficient.

We present an empirical study on applying CPO to simulate a post-editing workflow for data-efficient domain adaptation. Our approach synthesizes preference pairs by treating the base model's own raw output as the 'rejected' translation and the human-approved TM entry as the 'chosen' one. This method provides direct feedback on the model's current knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards. Experiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by using just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that of a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data efficiency. Although we showcase its effectiveness in MT, this application of CPO naturally generalizes to other generative tasks where a model's initial drafts can serve as a contrastive signal against a golden reference."

Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap, the medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific corpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three languages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we conducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models were fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch clinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical notes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task performance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and general biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical domain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted model. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability. Moreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons contributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the feasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP. Within the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide meaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate the lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance."

DialectalArabicMMLU extends the MMLU-Redux framework through manual translation and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs into five major dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, and Moroccan), yielding a total of 15K QA pairs across 32 academic and professional domains (22K QA pairs when also including English and MSA). The benchmark enables systematic assessment of LLM reasoning and comprehension beyond MSA, supporting both task-based and linguistic analysis. We evaluate 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs (1B-13B parameters) and report substantial performance variation across dialects, revealing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization.

However, these summaries often focus on patients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns. To achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial Intelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries (PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture patient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current open-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a mixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients and 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured interviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be included in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical use. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create gold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen consultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five open-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and Qwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot prompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients emphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care values. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional context. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L 0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B (ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683).

    "abstract": "Machine learning models typically assume that training and test data follow the same distribution, an assumption that often fails in real-world scenarios due to distribution shifts. This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource settings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust generalization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by learning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal mechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct causal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we investigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically generates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious correlations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the NaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically equivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we explore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the DINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment analysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate that both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data augmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment classification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with varying gains across languages."

    "abstract": "Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling. We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First, when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause the action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model reasoning, and principled CoT interventions."

Using measures of association strength (Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus), frequency (BNC), and predictability (LaDEC), we compute embedding-derived LMD and ST metrics and assess their relationships with human judgments via Spearmans correlation and regression analyses. Our results show that BERT embeddings better capture compositional semantics than GloVe, and that predictability ratings are strong predictors of semantic transparency in both human and model data.

    "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable advancements, with the test-time scaling law consistently enhancing the reasoning capabilities. Through systematic evaluation and exploration of a diverse spectrum of intermediate thoughts, LLMs demonstrate the potential to generate deliberate reasoning steps, thereby substantially enhancing reasoning accuracy. However, LLMs' autoregressive generation paradigm results in reasoning performance scaling sub-optimally with test-time computation, often requiring excessive computational overhead to propose thoughts while yielding only marginal performance gains. In contrast, diffusion language models (DLMs) can efficiently produce diverse samples through parallel denoising in a single forward pass, inspiring us to leverage them for proposing intermediate thoughts, thereby alleviating the computational burden associated with autoregressive generation while maintaining quality. In this work, we propose an efficient collaborative reasoning framework, leveraging DLMs to generate candidate thoughts and LLMs to evaluate their quality. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance in complex reasoning tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.

To address this, we introduce \\textbf{V}ariance-\\textbf{C}ontrolled \\textbf{O}ptimization-based \\textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled framework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization problem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby aligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning generalization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently outperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on mathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B, 32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Moreover, we show that VCORE serves as a more effective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a stronger foundation for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Code will be released at\nthis https URL\n."

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and ``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper introduces \\textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency."

    "abstract": "Advances in large language models are making personalized AI agents a new research focus. While current agent systems primarily rely on personalized external memory databases to deliver customized experiences, they face challenges such as memory redundancy, memory staleness, and poor memory-context integration, largely due to the lack of effective memory updates during interaction. To tackle these issues, we propose a new memory management system designed for affective scenarios. Our approach employs a Bayesian-inspired memory update algorithm with the concept of memory entropy, enabling the agent to autonomously maintain a dynamically updated memory vector database by minimizing global entropy to provide more personalized services. To better evaluate the system's effectiveness in this context, we propose DABench, a benchmark focusing on emotional expression and emotional change toward objects. Experimental results demonstrate that, our system achieves superior performance in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the Bayesian-inspired update mechanism in alleviating memory bloat. Our work offers new insights into the design of long-term memory systems."

    "abstract": "Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable language models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and difficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2) steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and controllable at minimal marginal cost."

    "abstract": "Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual knowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge storage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing methods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are often identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other components, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing. This imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing effectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on advanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual knowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these insights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further analysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an optimal range across diverse settings."

    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning. Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace, the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability), but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness). Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work."

Unlike previous works that manipulate the hidden representations to steer LLM generation, we harness them as discriminative signals to guide the tree structured response space exploration. In each node expansion, a classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism that efficiently allocates computational resources by prioritizing higher score candidates for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We then propose a branch aggregation method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by aggregating their CoT scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them, achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning benchmarks."

    "abstract": "In the absence of sizable training data for most world languages and NLP tasks, translation-based strategies such as translate-test -- evaluating on noisy source language data translated from the target language -- and translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the source language -- have been established as competitive approaches for cross-lingual transfer (XLT). For token classification tasks, these strategies require label projection: mapping the labels from each token in the original sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. To this end, it is common to leverage multilingual word aligners (WAs) derived from encoder language models such as mBERT or LaBSE. Despite obvious associations between machine translation (MT) and WA, research on extracting alignments with MT models is largely limited to exploiting cross-attention in encoder-decoder architectures, yielding poor WA results. In this work, in contrast, we propose TransAlign, a novel word aligner that utilizes the encoder of a massively multilingual MT model. We show that TransAlign not only achieves strong WA performance but substantially outperforms popular WA and state-of-the-art non-WA-based label projection methods in MT-based XLT for token classification."

    "abstract": "A central architectural question for both biological and artificial intelligence is whether judgment relies on specialized modules or a unified, domain-general resource. While the discovery of decodable neural representations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has suggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly independent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a convergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse evaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the Valence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence (\"what is good\") and the model's assent to factual claims (\"what is true\"). Through direct interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical dependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative process to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at the cost of factual accuracy. This mechanism, which we term the subordination of reasoning, shifts the process of reasoning from impartial inference toward goal-directed justification. Our discovery offers a mechanistic account for systemic bias and hallucination, revealing how an architecture that promotes coherent judgment can systematically undermine faithful reasoning."

Most training data attribution (TDA) methods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often using leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be attributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an operational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining corpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a simple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST embeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference, we consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2 and report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much longer spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote or suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also increases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale.

    "abstract": "Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap, performing better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

In the second-order case, HLA maintains a constant-size state and computes per-token outputs in linear time without materializing any $n \\times n$ matrices. We give closed-form streaming identities, a strictly causal masked variant using two additional summaries, and a chunk-parallel training scheme based on associative scans that reproduces the activations of a serial recurrence exactly.

First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder to the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a lightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft slots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the signal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3% preference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged Q&A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced tokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the model having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity.

First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations, accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities. From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and 2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each memory component."

We address this question by introducing a new method called AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS). APS adopts a canonical periodicity detection algorithm and is able to identify any significant periods that exist in the surprisal sequence of a single document. By applying the algorithm to a set of corpora, we have obtained the following interesting results: Firstly, a considerable proportion of human language demonstrates a strong pattern of periodicity in information; Secondly, new periods that are outside the distributions of typical structural units in text (e.g., sentence boundaries, elementary discourse units, etc.) are found and further confirmed via harmonic regression modeling. We conclude that the periodicity of information in language is a joint outcome from both structured factors and other driving factors that take effect at longer distances. The advantages of our periodicity detection method and its potentials in LLM-generation detection are further discussed."

In this paper, we propose MemeArena, an agent-based arena-style evaluation framework that provides a context-aware and unbiased assessment for mLLMs' understanding of multimodal harmfulness. Specifically, MemeArena simulates diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks that elicit perspective-specific analyses from mLLMs. By integrating varied viewpoints and reaching consensus among evaluators, it enables fair and unbiased comparisons of mLLMs' abilities to interpret multimodal harmfulness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the evaluation biases of judge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences, offering valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations in multimodal harmfulness understanding.

    "abstract": "As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding, makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems."

However, data sparsity remains prevalent, in the form of missing feature types, incomplete language entries, and limited genealogical coverage. This limits the usefulness of URIEL+ in cross-lingual transfer, particularly for supporting low-resource languages. To address this sparsity, this paper extends URIEL+ with three contributions: introducing script vectors to represent writing system properties for 7,488 languages, integrating Glottolog to add 18,710 additional languages, and expanding lineage imputation for 26,449 languages by propagating typological and script features across genealogies. These additions reduce feature sparsity by 14% for script vectors, increase language coverage by up to 19,015 languages (1,007%), and improve imputation quality metrics by up to 33%. Our benchmark on cross-lingual transfer tasks (oriented around low-resource languages) shows occasionally divergent performance compared to URIEL+, with performance gains up to 6% in certain setups. Our advances make URIEL+ more complete and inclusive for multilingual research."

We present Glia, an AI architecture for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning, experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for complex systems problems."

Lately, using large language models (LLMs) for evaluating these generations has gained traction, as they tend to align more closely with human preferences than conventional n-gram or embedding-based metrics. In our experiments, we show that LLM judges have low intra-rater reliability in their assigned scores across different runs. This variance makes their ratings inconsistent, almost arbitrary in the worst case, making it difficult to measure how good their judgments actually are. We quantify this inconsistency across different NLG tasks and benchmarks and see if judicious use of LLM judges can still be useful following proper guidelines."

However, these measures can inadvertently introduce or reflect new biases, as LLMs may refuse to generate harmful content targeting some demographic groups and not others. We explore this selective refusal bias in LLM guardrails through the lens of refusal rates of targeted individual and intersectional demographic groups, types of LLM responses, and length of generated refusals. Our results show evidence of selective refusal bias across gender, sexual orientation, nationality, and religion attributes. This leads us to investigate additional safety implications via an indirect attack, where we target previously refused groups.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the limitations of large-scale language models in safety alignment and robustness by proposing a fine-tuning method that combines contrastive distillation with noise-robust training. The method freezes the backbone model and transfers the knowledge boundaries of the teacher model to the student model through distillation, thereby improving semantic consistency and alignment accuracy. At the same time, noise perturbations and robust optimization constraints are introduced during training to ensure that the model maintains stable predictive outputs under noisy and uncertain inputs. The overall framework consists of distillation loss, robustness loss, and a regularization term, forming a unified optimization objective that balances alignment ability with resistance to interference. To systematically validate its effectiveness, the study designs experiments from multiple perspectives, including distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis under computation budgets and mixed-precision environments, and the impact of data noise and distribution shifts on model performance. Results show that the method significantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness, and overall safety, achieving the best performance across several key metrics. This work not only enriches the theoretical system of parameter-efficient fine-tuning but also provides a new solution for building safer and more trustworthy alignment mechanisms."

We review existing equivalence and similarity notions and introduce EMOC: An Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm implementations into a feature space suitable for downstream tasks. We compile PACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three problems, and show that EMOC features support clustering and classification of algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity in LLM-generated programs.

Experiments show that CoDeC produces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and unseen datasets, and reveals strong evidence of memorization in open-weight models with undisclosed training corpora. The method is simple, automated, and both model- and dataset-agnostic, making it easy to integrate with benchmark evaluations."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the issues of insufficient coverage, unstable results, and limited reliability in retrieval-augmented generation under complex knowledge environments, and proposes a confidence control method that integrates multi-granularity memory indexing with uncertainty estimation. The method builds a hierarchical memory structure that divides knowledge representations into different levels of granularity, enabling dynamic indexing and retrieval from local details to global context, and thus establishing closer semantic connections between retrieval and generation. On this basis, an uncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and filter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model to maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false content. The overall optimization objective consists of generation loss, entropy constraints, and variance regularization, forming a unified confidence control framework. In the experiments, comprehensive sensitivity tests and comparative analyses were designed, covering hyperparameters, environmental conditions, and data structures, to verify the stability and robustness of the proposed method across different scenarios. The results show that the method achieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval recall, ranking quality, and factual consistency, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining multi-granularity indexing with confidence control. This study not only provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented generation but also offers practical evidence for improving the reliability and controllability of large models in complex contexts."

Existing metrics either evaluate isolated responses or treat unverifiable content as errors, limiting their use for multi-turn dialogue. We introduce VISTA (Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment), a framework for evaluating conversational factuality through claim-level verification and sequential consistency tracking. VISTA decomposes each assistant turn into atomic factual claims, verifies them against trusted sources and dialogue history, and categorizes unverifiable statements (subjective, contradicted, lacking evidence, or abstaining). Across eight large language models and four dialogue factuality benchmarks (AIS, BEGIN, FAITHDIAL, and FADE), VISTA substantially improves hallucination detection over FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge baselines. Human evaluation confirms that VISTA's decomposition improves annotator agreement and reveals inconsistencies in existing benchmarks. By modeling factuality as a dynamic property of conversation, VISTA offers a more transparent, human-aligned measure of truthfulness in dialogue systems."

However, showing that only natural-language-like systems optimise this tradeoff has proven elusive, and the existing solution has relied on ad-hoc constraints to rule out unnatural systems (Yang and Regier, 2025). Here, we argue that this issue arises because the proposed trade-off has neglected regularity, a crucial aspect of complexity central to human grammars in general. Drawing on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach, we propose that recursive numeral systems are better viewed as efficient with regard to their regularity and processing complexity. We show that our MDL-based measures of regularity and processing complexity better capture the key differences between attested, natural systems and unattested but possible ones, including \"optimal\" recursive numeral systems from previous work, and that the ad-hoc constraints from previous literature naturally follow from regularity. Our approach highlights the need to incorporate regularity across sets of forms in studies that attempt to measure and explain optimality in language."

For cultural nuances and linguistic representation, we conducted a two-stage user study (n=66) involving native speakers to explore how sexism is defined and articulated in everyday discourse. We further experiment with both traditional machine learning classifiers and pre-trained multilingual language models and evaluating the effectiveness few-shot learning in detecting sexism in Hausa.

However, LLMs still require further alignment to adhere to downstream task requirements and stylistic preferences, among other desired properties. As LLMs continue to scale in terms of size, the computational cost of alignment procedures increase prohibitively. In this work, we propose a novel approach to circumvent these costs via proxy-based test-time alignment, i.e. using guidance from a small aligned model. Our approach can be described as token-specific cascading method, where the token-specific deferral rule is reduced to 0-1 knapsack problem. In this setting, we derive primal and dual approximations of the optimal deferral decision. We experimentally show the benefits of our method both in task performance and speculative decoding speed."

Conversations shared with these models may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which, if exposed, could lead to security breaches or identity theft. To address this challenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with Semantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a semantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when using remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our approach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of conversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are automatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate, privacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world conversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to assess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's response. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy."

    "abstract": "Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like Twitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However, automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually appropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation. This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention mechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale, diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue contexts."

Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an off-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds each plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a low-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for unseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.\nBeyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the likelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space. This guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving rule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV improves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline methods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement framework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning domains. These results show that safety-separable latent spaces offer a scalable, plug-and-play primitive for reliable neurosymbolic plan verification. Code and data are available at:\nthis https URL\n."

    "abstract": "Hybrid models that combine state space models (SSMs) with attention mechanisms have shown strong performance by leveraging the efficiency of SSMs and the high recall ability of attention. However, the architectural design choices behind these hybrid models remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we analyze hybrid architectures through the lens of memory utilization and overall performance, and propose a complementary method to further enhance their effectiveness. We first examine the distinction between sequential and parallel integration of SSM and attention layers. Our analysis reveals several interesting findings, including that sequential hybrids perform better on shorter contexts, whereas parallel hybrids are more effective for longer contexts. We also introduce a data-centric approach of continually training on datasets augmented with paraphrases, which further enhances recall while preserving other capabilities. It generalizes well across different base models and outperforms architectural modifications aimed at enhancing recall. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of hybrid SSM-attention models and offer practical guidance for designing architectures tailored to various use cases.

Denario can perform many different tasks, such as generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans, writing and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a scientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle specific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end scientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we describe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine, neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such technology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code at\nthis https URL\n.

    "abstract": "Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study, we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

    "abstract": "As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal, self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase. The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions traces."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we demonstrate that simply reverting to \\textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16 uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL fine-tuning."

    "abstract": "We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems. Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50 problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization. Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%. Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.\nthis https URL"

    "abstract": "In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\nFrom this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry, despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures. Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\nThen, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning."

Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation, as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization to improve model alignment to human values."

In practice, they depend on a non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a novel architecture that enables truly \"end-to-end\" generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.\nThrough extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from \"hacking the test set\"-a practical upper bound for any static method. Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g., \"generate with low randomness\") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive LLM decoding."

    "abstract": "We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR) transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical delta rule.\nWe pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output lengths.\nTo support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model checkpoints."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs, without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7% improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs."

    "abstract": "Multimodal retrieval systems are expected to operate in a semantic space, agnostic to the language or cultural origin of the query. In practice, however, retrieval outcomes systematically reflect perspectival biases: deviations shaped by linguistic prevalence and cultural associations. We study two such biases. First, prevalence bias refers to the tendency to favor entries from prevalent languages over semantically faithful entries in image-to-text retrieval. Second, association bias refers to the tendency to favor images culturally associated with the query over semantically correct ones in text-to-image retrieval. Results show that explicit alignment is a more effective strategy for mitigating prevalence bias. However, association bias remains a distinct and more challenging problem. These findings suggest that achieving truly equitable multimodal systems requires targeted strategies beyond simple data scaling and that bias arising from cultural association may be treated as a more challenging problem than one arising from linguistic prevalence."

    "abstract": "We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without additional training."

This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative analysis especially \\textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM, pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\\sim$150M to $\\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for developing powerful and efficient LLMs."

We introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks. SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured, query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their outputs into coherent, context-aware answers.

In this paper, we systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and provide insights for enhancing their reliability.

However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability, including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring. By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities. Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and strategy coding."

Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods.

However, its application is often hindered by low \\textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \\textbf{Reward Density Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of exploration cost. This paper introduce \\textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \\textbf{Subproblem decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards, thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \\textbf{Failure-guided hints}: injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the probability of successful outcomes. 3) \\textbf{Dual-agent refinement}: employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to advanced proprietary LLMs."

We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3 tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific."

Despite the language's high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches have significantly advanced performance on this task.\nIn this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set, conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the input's vector representation.\nThrough a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities. These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization."

    "abstract": "Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze. Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured, lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex legal texts."

Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.\nResults: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78). The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76). Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3 Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522 (0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).\nConclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone."

However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation. Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database. The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change. DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling 1,072 tasks.

    "abstract": "Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well. Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering, provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems."

However, these models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune, require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs, underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification."

    "abstract": "Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations, this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew effect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average."

    "abstract": "Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase. To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored. Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments."

We introduce \\underline{S}ynergistic \\underline{S}parse and \\underline{L}ow-Rank \\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models (7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably, SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\\% with no performance drop and achieves at least 1.63$\\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM deployment."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks where malicious prompts are disguised using ciphers and character-level encodings to bypass safety guardrails. While these guardrails often fail to interpret the encoded content, the underlying models can still process the harmful instructions. We introduce CPT-Filtering, a novel, model-agnostic with negligible-costs and near-perfect accuracy guardrail technique that aims to mitigate these attacks by leveraging the intrinsic behavior of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers. Our method is based on the principle that tokenizers, trained on natural language, represent out-of-distribution text, such as ciphers, using a significantly higher number of shorter tokens. Our technique uses a simple yet powerful artifact of using language models: the average number of Characters Per Token (CPT) in the text. This approach is motivated by the high compute cost of modern methods - relying on added modules such as dedicated LLMs or perplexity models. We validate our approach across a large dataset of over 100,000 prompts, testing numerous encoding schemes with several popular tokenizers. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple CPT threshold robustly identifies encoded text with high accuracy, even for very short inputs. CPT-Filtering provides a practical defense layer that can be immediately deployed for real-time text filtering and offline data curation."

    "abstract": "Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement. During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity. This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs. The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and 20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education. Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro surpassed 60\\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\\%. These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the challenges of applying LLMs in education."

    "abstract": "While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method constructs a \"language model graph\" that maps relationships between models from the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM teams."

In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples, which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited computational resources.

To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content and cognitive dimensions.\nExperiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points, while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing critical domain gaps in LLMs."

However, real-world deployment faces three key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications."

These findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs' architectures."

However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1) external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics; (2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding."

However, current watermarking solutions hardly resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of `correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom, covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in practice."

We study five distillation formulations across CLIP and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual QA.

Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias toward loanwords rather than native equivalents.

Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\\% higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks.

We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans. Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g., free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition) that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs."

Current RAG evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG -- which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10 most cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks, with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model, GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1, validating the effectiveness of our method."

While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g., length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders. WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7 datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer, and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them. WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance. They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method for practitioners to better understand and use preference data."

We identify and formally characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps, erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0). Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving stable and controllable diffusion text generation."

    "abstract": "Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template, overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess instruction robustness."

To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy, exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility. SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple \"attention heads.\" Extensive experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens, further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition, real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures."

Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model checkpoints to facilitate future research."

We propose Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic, requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks. Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning."

Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10 different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast, Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation, Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of effective communication."

    "abstract": "While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common \"one problem, one solution\" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we propose a \"one problem, multiple solutions\" (1PNS) training paradigm that exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16 over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that 1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS.

This task can be viewed as a language generation task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic. However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3 reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation API to support further research."

However, the research and development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models. ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard. Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco, featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages. ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12 representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets, with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing'' capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments, we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale. Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better debiasing methods."

We employ a dynamic two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings, our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories.

Their prevalence, features, and clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9% women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis, biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small, low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective follow-up."

    "abstract": "Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational convergence can inadvertently cause \"cultural erasure\", the functional loss of providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure. Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the limitations of current alignment techniques."

However, these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine, thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer. Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps."

In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies, failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies. In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description, explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations, their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even with advanced prompting strategies.

For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical \"actions\". SRL trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance. Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of 1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation."

Trainium, an AI accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to 2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference."

Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and trustworthy AI in formal domains."

While sentiment preservation in translation has long been studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence. Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation, particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in downstream applications."

    "abstract": "The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot language from within a specific family does not consistently improve performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a significant \"curse of multilinguality\" as the number of training languages increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data, when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without compromising performance, even in low-resource settings"

We believe the most compelling evidence arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase."

Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research, comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all metrics, except for annotation time."

In this work, we propose a framework for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)."

However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks: (1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM raters."

Through this work, we study how data filtering and contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination -- continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation, evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development."

To address these challenges, we argue that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks, annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and 14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards. Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art frontier models."

Although diagrams are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams, sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature, quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:\nthis https URL\n."

To support this shift, we introduce collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.

To address this gap, we introduce the Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604 tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP, and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits, baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments."

However, the current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection, data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems.

Our task instances are automatically constructed by injecting realistic README errors and are validated in Docker for scalable, high-quality evaluation. Enconda-bench combines process-level analysis with end-to-end executability to enable capability assessments beyond aggregate success rates. Evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs and agent frameworks show that while agents can localize errors, they struggle to translate feedback into effective corrections, limiting end-to-end performance.

We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly. We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples, forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines.

The encoder uses masked spectral pretraining with phase-consistency regularization, plus a light cross-modal alignment that ties RF features to compact, human-interpretable policy tokens. To reduce unsafe actions under distribution shift, we add a calibrated selective-abstention head; the chosen risk-coverage operating point is registered and bound into the proof. We implement a four-stage proving pipeline: (C1) feature sanity and commitment, (C2) threshold and version binding, (C3) time-window binding, and (C4) PLONK-style proofs that the quantized network, given the committed window, produced the logged action and confidence. Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a gateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates with differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization without weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are part of each public statement. Across activity, presence or intrusion, respiratory proxy, and RF fingerprinting tasks, ZK-SenseLM improves macro-F1 and calibration, yields favorable coverage-risk curves under perturbations, and rejects tamper and replay with compact proofs and fast verification."

Traditional vector database methods often miss nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR) method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from 10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a 58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78 percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing. The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and computational efficiency are critical."

Despite recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap, specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis. Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning 42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and achieving a 10\\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins, EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis."

In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming, introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences."

This issue is particularly critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex, multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries, progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable 97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains."

To address this limitation, this paper studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities. Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration in AI systems.\nthis https URL"

    "abstract": "Recent advances in speech foundation models (SFMs) have enabled the direct processing of spoken language from raw audio, bypassing intermediate textual representations. This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially respond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal. One under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality, encompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation types are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and social meaning in speech. Existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely rely on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats, which are prone to failure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic features influence model behaviour. In this paper, we probe SFMs through open-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition, evaluating whether model behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs. We introduce a new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality, designed to evaluate SFM responses to creaky and breathy voice. Our work provides the first examination of SFM sensitivity to these particular non-lexical aspects of speech perception."

    "abstract": "We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN) architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially large Hilbert space $\\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction, making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints. At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory, and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise) grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks."

However, current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona (public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone, and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human baseline."

The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains. The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge management and security operations."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators, creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and deploying proactive dialogue agents \\textit{directly from offline expert data}, bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \\textbf{observed future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense, turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy, decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \\texttt{(action, state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \\textbf{what to ask} and, crucially, \\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations, our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts, proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible, real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented LLM applications."

    "abstract": "Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches that rely on independent generations."

    "abstract": "Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions: paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception; however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy, thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving transparency and reliability."

We argue that advancing HCI requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore, implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models. Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction more natural and contextually grounded."

Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering, annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted, slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media."

We propose a new LLM serving system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and extensible ecosystem for LLM applications."

Evaluation of 29+ LLMs reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law, International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science, and Human Rights remain notably weak.

We present an LLM-driven pipeline that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for mental health support.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization."

Traditional expert-based methods struggle to keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology. In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological convergence.\nOur approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend analysis of topic co-occurence.\nWe validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text analysis."

Results show that instruction tuning yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits."

This work offers an empirical argument against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the conclusions produced by generative AI."

To address these challenges, we propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization, especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for real-world applications."

However, existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution, failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

Current research typically endeavors to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL baseline, which is resource-intensive."

We propose PEKD, a unified framework that enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario.

Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length, token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies.

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together. Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster, better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the generic baseline (10.65\\% vs 7.01\\%) while being 77\\% faster in response (15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous, theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially intelligent agents."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts. Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model \"views\" input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task, which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality."

However, a significant portion of readily available long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient, making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining. LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings, thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential. Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones. Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes problem-specific strategies in reasoning."

Does their impressive performance reflect genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages. Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa (low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide, significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of \"overthinking\" that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions."

    "abstract": "AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that redefines how models interact with documents.\nWe introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for reasoning.\nAs an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation."

Building on existing works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance. Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set. Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both seen and unseen acoustic conditions."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a wave of \"MLLM-r1\" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However, SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting, weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation; (2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow, transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%. Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing in-distribution \"stuckness,\" improving exploration, stabilizing training, and raising the performance ceiling."

To address this, we introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric), while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation."

While recent knowledge editing techniques hint at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates, potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs."

Although this work considers several low-resource languages, including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented populations.

While role-playing large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107 controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics. We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics (e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically simulating human-like social dynamics."

    "abstract": "Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs) iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries, and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision, which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling. Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1 achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities."

Using the CRAFT corpus as our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.

This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity), a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL) defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors, the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and (ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable, generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive multidimensional discourse analysis."

In this study, we examine whether large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own reasoning process."

    "abstract": "Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2) under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of implicit gaps inference, we introduce \\textbf{\\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps. This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment, including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking across open- and closed-weight models."

    "abstract": "Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples, a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community."

    "abstract": "Automatically configuring storage systems is hard: parameter spaces are large and conditions vary across workloads, deployments, and versions. Heuristic and ML tuners are often system specific, require manual glue, and degrade under changes. Recent LLM-based approaches help but usually treat tuning as a single-shot, system-specific task, which limits cross-system reuse, constrains exploration, and weakens validation. We present StorageXTuner, an LLM agent-driven auto-tuning framework for heterogeneous storage engines. StorageXTuner separates concerns across four agents - Executor (sandboxed benchmarking), Extractor (performance digest), Searcher (insight-guided configuration exploration), and Reflector (insight generation and management). The design couples an insight-driven tree search with layered memory that promotes empirically validated insights and employs lightweight checkers to guard against unsafe actions. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on RocksDB, LevelDB, CacheLib, and MySQL InnoDB with YCSB, MixGraph, and TPC-H/C. Relative to out-of-the-box settings and to ELMo-Tune, StorageXTuner reaches up to 575% and 111% higher throughput, reduces p99 latency by as much as 88% and 56%, and converges with fewer trials."

    "abstract": "Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models (LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis, and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution. Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar performance by composing information across layers through query-value interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in spoken language processing have led to substantial progress in phonetic tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme conversion (P2G). Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have largely been studied in isolation, each relying on task-specific architectures and datasets. In this paper, we introduce POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech Model), the first unified framework capable of jointly performing multiple phone-related tasks. POWSM enables seamless conversion between audio, text (graphemes), and phones, opening up new possibilities for universal and low-resource speech processing. Our model outperforms or matches specialized PR models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P, P2G, and ASR. Our training data, code and models are released to foster open science."
